# AppComponents
Simple model for elm-like composable programs in Swift

This playground attempts to duplicate the architecture [prescribed for Elm]("https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial"), while still remaining as Swift-y as possible.

Views are rendered using [DePict]("https://github.com/davidcairns/DePict"), and the operators for stacking elements are taken from that as well.

It ought to be possible to make events work the same way as in [the Elm version]("https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial#example-1-a-counter"), but I havenâ€™t yet figured it out.

Please feel free to submit a pull request!
